#Code Challenge

The goal of this code challenge is to create a few functions that will shuffle/deal cards and calculate which player has the better standard 5-card poker hand.

When developing, think about the following:

- What functions belong to the component, and which should be an redux action
- Which state items should belong to the component, and which should be in the redux store
- How do you write your code such that it is unit testable

##Bonus Points

- Implement a shuffling algorithm for dealing the cards
- Stylize the cards 
- Implement some visual for shuffling
- Add a betting component

#Project Information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install all modules from package.json, allow you to run your application

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
